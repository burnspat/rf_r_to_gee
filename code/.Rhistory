# SCRIPT METADATA ==========================================================================================
# Description: R script to format a random forest model fit in 'ranger' or 'randomForest' for upload to Google Earth Engine
# Script Author: Kathleen Orndahl & Patrick Burns
# Script Date: 2024-08-30
# NOTES:
# This code has not been robustly tested on all use cases and may require some troubleshooting depending on the parameters used in creating the models.
# The script can correctly encode categorical variables, but note that categorical variables are not currently supported by GEE models (unless they are one hot encoded, see below).
# For use in GEE, categorical predictors can be one hot encoded. In this instance, each categorical level should be treated as a separate, numerical predictor during model building.
